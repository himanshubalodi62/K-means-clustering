# K-means-clustering

+ Cluster analysis is also called clustering.
+ It is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
+ Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them.

##### Explain what is k-Means Clustering?  
+ k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
+ k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances.
+ Within-cluster-variance is simple to understand measure of compactness. So basically, the objective is to find the most compact partitioning of the data set into k partitions.
