# K-means-clustering

+ Cluster analysis is also called clustering.
+ It is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.
+ Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them.
